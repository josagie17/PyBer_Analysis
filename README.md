Analysis Overview
This data analysis is to identify key ride sharing metrics by city type and to create a graphical representation of the total weekly fares based on the city types which will help improve access to ride sharing services and determine ride affordability.
The city type are as follows:
Rural
Suburban

Summary

From the Tables and chart, it can be seen that the Urban cities generates a lot more revenue than the Suburban and rural cities.

Recommendations

1) Increase the number of drivers in the Rural cities by offering incentives to the driver. The increase in drivers will reduce the cost for riders
2) Offer promos to the riders in the Rural areas to increase the total number of riders which will drive the revenue generation up.
3) Find out why there are less riders and drivers in the rural areas. Could it be distance, or less drivers stay in those areas.
